# Unit & Integration testing

This is a demo repo with bunch little projects to practice testing using `vitest`.

In the `basic-testing-*` folders are simple tests that cover basics of unit and integration tests.

In the `async-code` folder are tests that cover work with asynchronous code.

In the `hooks` folder are tests that cover work with testing hooks like `beforeEach` or `afterEach`.

In the `spies&mocks` folders are tests that cover basics of creating mocks and spies for internal functions and packages, testing the DOM with `happy-dom` library. It is not suitable for complex client-side projects, but can give a little knowledge of how to test with DOM manipulations
